But with Masai, it is quite evident that the individuals are given a well-rounded education into the different aspects besides programming that go into software engineering. The college curriculum while focusing on the theoretical aspects of programming hasn't really evolved to keep pace with the practical aspects of software engineering. Companies too can benefit significantly by sourcing developers from Masai as they have good familiarity with the tools and processes that go into building software solutions. The dominant trait amongst Masai graduates has mostly been to focus on gaining more knowledge. Arya Adarsha Gautam ARYA ADARSHA GAUTAM CTO and Co-Founder - Pagarbook Pagarbook Masai does a great job of attracting ambitious folk and it shows in the hunger with which the grads chase their own improvement and career advancement. The curriculum is shaped such that its graduates come into the job with with an understanding of workplace and technology practices that is simply missing from freshers hired from colleges. They continuously look for feedback for their curriculum and ensure that it is up to date with the pulse of the ecosystem.

As India’s fastest growing career institute, Masai has one goal: unlocking the human potential of India by making our education system outcome driven.   The Masai Story quote-openquote-close What if educational institutions shared the monetary risks their students take on when they invest in higher education? Our Co-Founder & CEO, Prateek Shukla was teaching with Teach For India during his pre-final year at IIT Kanpur and stumbled upon the education problem in India and how under-tapped India’s true potential is. During a vacation to Kenya and Tanzania a few years later, he met with the Chieftain of the Maasai Mara Tribe. He learnt about the robust skilling techniques the tribe follows to keep themselves always able and self-sustained.  Back in India, he realised that every technology company spends about 6 months in training their new recruits before they move on to contribute to the organisational goals. Finding an opportunity to help upskill Bharat, Prateek got Nrupul Dev and Yogesh Bhat together to start Masai School in June 2019. They set out to build a military-style coding institute, based on the 9-9-6 intensive training regime that runs for 6 days in a week from 9am to 9pm. The holistic program includes 1200 hours of hands-on coding, 100 hours of soft skills training, 100 hours of mathematics and more.  Since, Masai has grown at a staggering rate. With thousands of enrolled students, Masai School is leading the Outcome Driven Education Revolution in India with new courses like Data Analytics now part of our offering.  alternative image 2019sunshine  We Started Our Journey  7000+  underline-svg Students Currently Enrolled  30+  Total Batches  96%  Placement Rate  * Post course completion & accreditation by Masai.  1400+  Hiring Partners  Meet Your Instructors The Curriculum Team is a group of instructors with extensive industry and training experience in some of India’s top companies.
